# React Portal

# Basic Usage

It is possible to wrap a React element with [Overlay](https://github.com/vtex-apps/react-portal/blob/master/react/Overlay.tsx) to make use of its advantages such as making the block overlap any other block dispite the its z-index

## Example:

```
<Overlay>
  <div>Hello World!</div>
</Overlay> 
```
